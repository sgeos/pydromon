# Line Configuration

> **Navigation**: [Protocol](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

**Status.** Draft, configuration version 1, written on 2026-10-25. Normative. The Python
module `dromon.lineconfig` implements it.

## Purpose

**Decided by the operator on 2026-10-25.** It must be possible to expose arbitrary MCP
servers to a session line, under either an allow-all or a whitelist model, with the
settings held per line. A line's configuration names its built-in Claude Code tools, the
MCP servers it connects to, and which tool calls are allowed.

## Document

```json
{
  "builtin_tools": ["Read", "Edit"],
  "mcp_servers": {
    "github": {"type": "stdio", "command": "gh-mcp", "args": ["--stdio"], "env": {"TOKEN": "..."}},
    "docs": {"type": "http", "url": "https://docs.example/mcp", "headers": {"Authorization": "..."}}
  },
  "tool_policy": "allowlist",
  "allowed_tools": ["mcp__github__*", "mcp__docs__search"],
  "inherit_account_mcp": false
}
```

Every key is optional, and an omitted key takes the default shown in the table. Unknown
keys, duplicate keys and numbers are refused.

| Key | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `builtin_tools` | Claude Code tool names, each a capital letter followed by letters, digits or `_` | none |
| `mcp_servers` | Server name to server, or a Claude Code file of the shape `{"mcpServers": {...}}` | none |
| `tool_policy` | `allowlist` or `allow_all` | `allowlist` |
| `allowed_tools` | Exact tool names, or `mcp__server__*` for every tool of one server | none |
| `inherit_account_mcp` | Also load the MCP servers of the operator's user settings and claude.ai account | `false` |

A server name is an identifier and may not be `dromon`, which Dromon's own tools use. A
`stdio` server has `command` and optionally `args` and `env`. An `http` or `sse` server
has `url` and optionally `headers`. A URL must use `https`, or `http` on `127.0.0.1` or
`localhost`. At most 256 entries are accepted in any list or mapping, and each text is
at most 4,096 characters.

## Policy

- `allowlist` allows the listed built-in tools, Dromon's own tools such as
  `send_message`, and every tool matching `allowed_tools`, and denies everything else.
- `allow_all` allows every tool the engine offers.
- No tool is approved in advance. Every call reaches the line's permission gate.
- Unless `inherit_account_mcp` is set, the engine runs with strict MCP configuration,
  and a turn is refused when the engine offers a built-in tool not in `builtin_tools`
  or a tool of a server not in `mcp_servers`.

## Storage

The daemon validates a configuration, then appends `line_configured` with its canonical
JSON, which adds `"v": 1` and sorts every key. A new configuration replaces the old one
whole and applies from the line's next turn, which resumes the same engine session.

## Trust

A configuration is operator authority and arrives only through the client. Server
`env` and `headers` may hold credentials. They are stored in the event log, whose file
is readable by its owner only. `allow_all` and `inherit_account_mcp` hand a line every
tool they bring, including a claude.ai account's mail and file connectors, and suit
only lines the operator trusts with them.

## Not yet specified

- References to secrets held outside the event log, such as environment variables.
- Per-project defaults, which arrive with per-project configuration in roadmap task 9.
