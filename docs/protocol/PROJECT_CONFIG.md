# Project Configuration

> **Navigation**: [Protocol](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

**Status.** Draft, file version 1, written on 2026-10-25. Normative. The Python module
`dromon.projectconfig` implements it, and `dromon.daemon` applies it.

## Purpose

A project declares its session lines, their engines and tools, its conversation limits
and its wake policy in `.dromon/dromon.toml`. The daemon reads the file when it starts.
`dromon config` validates the file without a daemon and prints a summary. By the
operator's direction, the format is expected to grow as large as a multi-agent project
needs, so it is strict and versioned from the start.

## Format

The file is TOML version 1.0, encoded in UTF-8, at most 4 MiB.

```toml
version = 1

[daemon]
operator = "ana"        # who hears about a held line no operator has messaged
tick_seconds = 0.5      # time between ticks while work is in flight, in [0, 60]

[limits]
max_autonomous_turns = 8
max_cost_usd = 1.5
cooldown_seconds = 0

[wake]
every_ticks = 2         # a line may start a turn only on ticks divisible by this

[profiles.reader]
model = "claude-haiku-5-5"
strategy = "subscription"
builtin_tools = ["Read", "Grep"]

[profiles.reader.mcp_servers.docs]
type = "http"
url = "https://docs.example/mcp"

[lines.alpha]
profile = "reader"

[lines.beta]
profile = "reader"
model = "claude-opus-5-5"
builtin_tools = ["Read"]
tool_policy = "allow_all"

[lines.beta.limits]
max_autonomous_turns = 3

[lines.beta.wake]
every_ticks = 5
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `version` | integer | required | Must be 1 |
| `daemon.operator` | identifier | `operator` | The default operator |
| `daemon.tick_seconds` | number in [0, 60] | 1 | The tick cadence |
| `limits.*` | as in `CLIENT.md` | 12, 2, 0 | The conversation limits of every line |
| `wake.every_ticks` | integer in [1, 3600] | 1 | The wake policy of every line |
| `profiles.NAME` | table | none | A reusable line template with every line key but `profile` |
| `lines.ID` | table | none | A line, named by a line identifier |
| `lines.ID.profile` | profile name | none | The profile the line starts from |
| `lines.ID.model` | model | required | `claude-opus-5-5` or `claude-haiku-5-5` |
| `lines.ID.strategy` | strategy | `subscription` | `subscription`, `api` or `flexible` |
| `lines.ID.limits` | table | the file's | Limits for this line, each key defaulting to the file's |
| `lines.ID.wake` | table | the file's | The wake policy for this line |
| tool keys | as in `LINE_CONFIG.md` | as there | `builtin_tools`, `mcp_servers`, `tool_policy`, `allowed_tools`, `inherit_account_mcp` |

## Rules

- **Strict keys.** A key that the table above does not name is an error, so a misspelt
  key is reported rather than ignored.
- **Profiles.** A line's own key replaces the profile's key whole. Lists and tables are
  not merged, so the tools of a line can be read in one place.
- **Precedence.** A `dromond` flag overrides the file, and the file overrides the
  built-in defaults. User and managed layers are not yet specified.
- **Located errors.** Every error names the file. A syntax error carries its line and
  column. Any other error carries the dotted key path and the line of its table or key
  when it can be found. The daemon refuses to start on an invalid file.
- **Application.** At start, a declared line that does not exist is created, and one
  whose tools differ is reconfigured. A line's model and strategy are fixed at
  creation, so a file that changes either is refused and the daemon does not start.
  Lines created through the client and absent from the file are left as they are.
- **Restart.** The policies of limits and wake live in the daemon and are re-read on
  every start. The lines and their configurations are events in the log.

## Trust

The file is operator configuration, committed with the project. It can grant a line
tools, MCP servers and the credentials in their `env` and `headers`, which are then
stored in the event log as `LINE_CONFIG.md` describes. It deserves the review any such
file does, and a project that holds secrets should keep them out of the committed file.
References to secrets held elsewhere are not yet specified.

## Comparison with other harnesses

Reviewed on 2026-10-25 from public documentation.

- **Claude Code** layers JSON settings, managed over command line over project local
  over shared project over user, and merges lists across layers.
  Source <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings>.
- **Codex** reads `~/.codex/config.toml` and a project `.codex/config.toml` that applies
  only to trusted projects, with profiles, `mcp_servers` tables, `-c` overrides and a
  `requirements.toml` for organizations.
  Source <https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference>.
- **Grok Build** reads `~/.grok/config.toml` and a project `.grok/config.toml`, with
  managed and requirements files under `/etc/grok`.
  Source <https://docs.x.ai/build/settings>.

Dromon follows the TOML and profile convention of Codex and Grok Build. It replaces
rather than merges lists, unlike Claude Code, so that a line's grant is explicit.
