## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `docs/architecture/KELEUSMA_INTEGRATION.md` records the `pykeleusma` line's answers to
  the four questions, the binding's current task status, and the tagged-tuple
  constraints it reported. One-element tuples in the examples became two-element ones.
- `CLAUDE.md` states that dates in tracked files are in Coordinated Universal Time.
- The design records two operator decisions. The protocol specification is drafted in
  this repository, and the first adapter targets Claude Opus 5.5.
- Roadmap task 1 is done. The seed was checked against Appendix B and nothing conflicts.

### Added

- `docs/architecture/KELEUSMA_INTEGRATION.md`, what Dromon needs from `pykeleusma`,
  mapped to that binding's tasks, for the `pykeleusma` line.
- The repository seed. The `pydromon` distribution with the import package `dromon`, the
  placeholder commands `dromond` and `dromon` with seven planned subcommands, smoke and
  command tests, the design, the naming and port decision, the 0.1.0 milestone and the
  process files. Ignored project-local `tmp/` and `secret/` directories, following the
  Keleusma repository.
